# Android API 29+ app to block calls from #s that impersonate your phone number prefix.
i.e. the app will block calls from ABC-DEF-XXXX if your phone number starts with ABC-DEF (first 6 numbers match).
TODO: prevent robocalls from leaving a voicemail by stealth accepting the call in the background and immediately ending it.
